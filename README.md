# Welcome to Athens

## Howdy partner

The Athens Research handbook documents all our operations.  New community members join us daily and every week we meet for a community call to discuss current projects. The city of Athens wasn't built in a day and neither was Athens Research. However, in less than two months, Athens went from an [idea](https://athens-research.ghost.io/mvp-update-funding-and-why-i-started-athens/) to a [funded project](https://opencollective.com/athens) and that momentum has only grown. We are now hiring!
