Please make a [pull request](https://github.com/athensresearch/handbook/pulls) for any suggested changes and improvements. For any questions use our [discussions board](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/discussions) or join us on [discord](https://discord.gg/as9h8yHNfD). Athens is a knowledge graph.
