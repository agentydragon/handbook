# Contributing Documentation

We use GitBook for all Athens documentation. GitBook modifies markdown files in our Athens repository which means that there are two ways to make or suggest changes to the handbook which are outlined below:

1. Github pull request: you can clone the handbook, make changes, then submit a pull request that details the suggested changes
2. Make comments and changes on GitBook with writer permissions: for those who are less comfortable with Github or want to contribute on a more regular basis, send a message to Johnny on Discord or to his email jmorabito10@gmail.com

Any and all are welcome and encouraged to make contributions and help us keep our handbook as up to date as possible! Outlined in the following sections are more detailed instructions as well as language and convention guidelines that we use.

## Language and Tone

Our handbook should assume zero prior knowledge and be descriptive without the unnecessary use of jargon or, if unnavoidable, link to definitions or educational pages that describe the jargon or concepts.



## Contributing Conventions 

### GitBook Writers

If you've been given access to the GitBook with writer permissions please use the following conventions as a guide:

1. Use comments on the main branch to ask for clarity for or updates to particular sections of the handbook
2. Make changes and updates to the handbook at your discretion. Describe your changes in detail in the draft window before merging
3. If you're unsure whether to merge your draft you can leave the changes in drafts and ask for a second opinion on the changes before merging

### Github 

Except for the ability to comment, the contribution workflow through Github is largely the same with the addition of using github issues.

1. Detail changes in your pull request
2. \[we do not have a use case yet for github issues in the handbooks repository\]
