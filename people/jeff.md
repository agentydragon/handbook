## **Bio**

I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio. My parents migrated from China 30 years ago to pursue the American Dream. Why did they come to Cincinnati? The University of Cincinnati was the only school to give my mom a scholarship. She went on to get a PhD in chemistry. My dad also got a scholarship, but at Xavier University. He was the first Asian to get an MBA from Xavier. My mom is now a chemist, and my dad is a bookkeeper, Chinese-American translator, and small-time landlord. I like to think I get book smarts from my mom and street smarts from my dad.

From 2015-17, I went to Rice University in Houston, Texas. My freshman year, I majored in chemical engineering and did part-time sales at Tesla Motors, evangelizing the product and giving test drives. My sophomore year, I switched my major to sociology and studied abroad at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. That summer I did Digital Marketing in Santiago, Chile at GroupRaise, a TechStars startup.

What would've been my junior year, I went to a coding bootcamp in San Francisco. I worked on a language learning chatbot startup for a few months, then interned at LiftIgniter \(YC W15\) as a frontend engineer.

What would've been my senior year, I went back to Rice, switched my major to computer science, then after a week took another leave of absence. I did interview prep like crazy. I got a 4-month contract at Strata Labs as a backend engineer, as their first employee. They were later acquired by Ripple. I then interned at Microsoft as a software engineer.

I got a full-time offer from Microsoft, but knew it wasn't for me, so I went back home to Ohio to work on startup ideas. I worked on a computer vision fitness app. A few months into it, Conor, the founder of Roam Research, asked me to interview from our interactions on Twitter.

I was rejected because I didn't have Clojure experience. I still wanted to work on knowledge graphs, and I believed everyone else should also have that right â€” to extend and own their second brains.

Open Source was the only option. Now, I have no doubt OSS will lead to the best product, platform, and community.

## My hobbies

I love exercising! In high school, I played football and lacrosse. I taught myself how to backflip in 2019 -- I dabble in parkour. These days, I hit the gym, do calisthenics, and play basketball. I've been working on handstands on and off for a few years.

I love music, dancing, and festivals. In 2019 I went to Bonnaroo, The Gorge \(to see Above & Beyond\), Capitol Hill Block Party, and Burning Man \)\(

## Communication Style

I am generally direct when I communicate. I try to "get to the point" if there is one. I think I am pretty good at being direct without being rude, but please let me know if I am and I will apologize and try to correct it.

Sometimes I do not explain my reasoning or ideas enough. Please interrupt me to explain something if it wasn't unclear.

I can speak authoritively. This is good when I am right and bad when I am wrong. Don't let my confident tone convince you of what I'm saying if it doesn't make sense from first principles.

## **Strengths**

I learn really fast. I believe everything boils to skill acquisition and learning. I believe all learning is the same, regardless if it is physical, mental, or psychological. I am mostly a self-taught programmer. Athens is my first Clojure project.

## Weaknesses

My greatest weakness is my ego/pride. The Ancient Greeks called this hubris. They illustrate this in the story of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun. Sometimes I push the limits too hard, and I hurt myself, such as when I hurt myself lifting too heavy.

Sometimes I am impatient and have commitment issues. I quit things if I don't immediately see the point or if I don't immediately progress with them. I had 3 different majors throughout my time at school. I've worked on Athens for more than a year, but the longest job I had before this was 4 months.
